So, those are different times when you might want to put on the expert hat. And hopefully the audience will realize why you’re doing that. – Mary (FCS, State 2).\n\nIndividual Questions/Crop Production: On another token, some of the work I do, there’s some facts that I know that are established and they’ve been established through years of research. And, I can tell a grower, “You know what, if you come into this field with the combine, the way your beans are situated and the height of your pods, you are very likely going to have a disaster.” I mean, I can kind of in an expert way say, it doesn’t mean I know everything about growing and farming beans and it doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of input as well, but on that specific point and that specific question, I can come across with a more expert, authoritative recommendation, based on knowledge and research. It would be a little bit like I just said. Some cut-and- dried, research-based information that I can impart. You know, if you have soil ridges in your field that are holding up the head of your combine, every inch of height that you raise on that combine is going to be the equivalent to about three bushels per acre harvest loss in yield. I can just tell a grower that and that’s based on, you know, multiple years of research, it’s a piece of valuable information. Then, they might not know it. So, if I really know my facts, or know this is such and such an insect, or you know, then I would impart that knowledge in that, in an authoritative, probably not the right word, but very, in a very confident fashion and they accept or reject that piece of information as they chose. – Ruby (ANR, State 1).\n\nIndividual Questions/Insect Identification: Well, for example, someone brings an insect, I’m a crops educator, but I deal with lawn and garden and in- sects and a wide array of questions and so on, so if somebody brings an insect into the office and asks me what it is and I say “It’s a bedbug,” and I would (have) no qualms or questions, because I know for sure that’s what it is. I guess that would be the expert model. You know, I know what it is and they are asking me, so, boom, I give them the information. I mean if I didn’t know what something was, then I’d say, “Well I’m not sure, it looks like this. I’ll have to investigate this more and then I’ll get back with you.” I guess I’m still not asking for their input. – Ruby (ANR, State 1).\n\nIndividual Questions/Pesticide Recommendations or Ration Balancing: Most people view me as a specialist in the areas of animal science and agrono- my, and so I get calls related to what pesticide to use, how to balance a ration for my steers in the feedlot, and so they’re basically drawing on my expertise or my ability to find that information for them. – Pike County (ANR, State 2).', 'url': 'https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/pubs_ext_vt_edu/en/ALCE/alce-301/alce-301.html'}, {'base_url': 'https://www.lsuagcenter.com', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 50, 'readable_filename': 'pesticidestewardshipmanual_ipm_pdfpdf.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/pesticidestewardshipmanual_ipm_pdfpdf.pdf', 'text': 'The Pesticide Stewardship of Specialty Crops Train the Trainer Handbook   |   Module 6       50\nSCOUTING/MONITORING\nA\nScouting (or monitoring) is a simple and effective \ntechnique for detection of pests before they reach \ndamaging levels.

What should I be looking for to confirm this?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Hi! It\'s important to regularly scout your crops for any signs of pests. You should look out for symptoms of plant stress and damage like wilting, stunting of plants, yellowing of leaves, defoliation or distortion of leaves, shot holes in leaves, webbing and dead plant material[^8^

Could this be due to a specific type of pest?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Yes, these symptoms could be caused by specific pests. However, the exact pest can vary depending on the crop and the region. For instance, aphids are common pests that can cause yellowing and wilting[^8^
                                ]. \n\n**Farmer**: I see. And how often should I be scouting my crops for these signs?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: During the growing season, scouting should be done at least once a week and then once a month during dormant periods[^8^

One more thing, once I\'ve identified the pests, what\'s the best approach for managing them?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Once you\'ve identified the pests, the next step is to determine if the pest problem is bad enough that control measures are necessary. This is often referred to as the economic threshold. If control is necessary, you would then select the best control methods, which could include cultural practices, use of reduced-risk pesticides, or biological controls[^13^

One approach to lessening human impact in a garden is to use practices that minimize or elimi-\nnate the need for pesticide application.  A pesticide is a broad term meant for many types of “pests.”  One \ntype of pesticide that people often use is an insecticide to kill insects that are harmful to cultivated plants. \nIntegrated pest management (IPM) is an environmentally-sensitive strategy for pest management in the \ngarden, as well as in agriculture.  This is a combined-practice approach where mechanical (e.g., lures and \ntraps), targeted chemical and biological controls (e.g., using natural enemies to the pests) are employed \nrather than relying on broadcast (often non-specific) chemicals.  IPM focuses on managing detrimental \ninsects and pests with the least possible impact on people, property and the environment. It prevents \npests from reaching unacceptable levels or reduces existing pest populations to acceptable levels. Tech-\nniques can include trapping and using bio-control methods and targeted chemical and biological pesticide \napplications.  Another method to control pests is the use of crop rotation. The physical location of different \ncrops is changed year by year in a planned sequence. With crop rotation, pesticide use may be reduced by \nnaturally breaking the cycles of weeds, insects and diseases.\n1. Discuss the traits of beneficial insects.  There are pollinators; producers of honey, wax, lacquer and silk; \nfood sources for cultures of the world (entomophagy). Also, insectivores control populations of pest \ninsects.  Ask students how ladybugs might be beneficial to plants. They act as biological controls; they \neat scale insects and aphids which are sap-sucking insects that are a pest on many plants including \nagricultural crops.\n2. Discuss the traits of “pest” insects.  They can destroy products and crops (e.g., termites, locusts, wee-\nvils), spread disease (e.g., mosquitoes, flies), and may compete with other beneficial insects.\n3. Ask students to define the criteria and constraints of the problem and how they can minimize human \nimpact on the environment.\n4. Introduce the concept of organic gardening, where synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are not used. \nThis approach to gardening is meant to support holistic health of the garden. In what ways does organ-\nic gardening lessen human impact and build a healthier system?  \n28\nUNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND  \n            \nSCHOOL GARDEN INITIATIVE', 'url': 'https://web.uri.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2042/SGI_K-8-Curriculum_10.20.17.pdf'}, {'base_url': 'https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/soap/Hanai-Ai', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 33, 'readable_filename': 'TSA_guide.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/TSA_guide.pdf', 'text': 'Toward Sustainable Agriculture: A Guide for Hawai‘i’s Farmers    27\nKnow your plants and animals\nChoices about which crops and livestock can be produced are limited by what best\nmatches the land’s physical environment, and they should also be guided by what is\nappropriate based on market considerations, as discussed in Chapter 6.\nWhen considering what to grow, learn everything you can about the biology and\nphysiology of the species. Nothing can take the place of a farmer’s thorough knowl-\nedge of the life cycle, nutritional needs, water requirements, and pest problems of\nthe crop. You will need to know the lowest and highest temperatures that can be\ntolerated, how long it takes from planting to harvest, and the optimum soil pH,\nmoisture, and fertility requirements. Much information is available from the UH-\nCTAHR Cooperative Extension Service. Also, look to other major universities\nlocated in similar climatic areas, such as the state universities in Florida and\nCalifornia, for additional sources of information. Commercial seed and other agri-\ncultural companies often also provide practical information about their products.\nTo match plants and animals to your local environment, look into the origin of the\nspecies, where it grows naturally, and how it performs commercially. Compare this\nwith the crops and animals already being raised in your area. Ask long-time farm-\ners about what they used to grow and what they are growing now. Make sure you\ncan obtain healthy, locally adapted planting materials or livestock.\nCrops that are in excellent health and well adapted to the local environment are\nmore likely to withstand damage from insects and diseases. You decrease the risk\nof pest damage by selecting the right plants and animals for your conditions. As\nyou gain more experience, you may try to overcome some limitations of your\necosystem and select a product that is more difficult to grow in Hawai‘i so that you\ncan get a price premium for it.\nPest management\nFarmers around the world invest considerable time and energy to protect their crops\nfrom diseases and pests. In modern conventional agriculture, pest control has often\nbeen synonymous with inorganic pesticide use. A more recent approach called inte-\ngrated pest management (IPM) has developed from acknowledgment that relying\nexclusively on inorganic pesticides is unwise. Pests can develop resistance to\npesticides; pest resurgence, often to higher levels than before, can occur because\npesticides indiscriminately eliminate natural enemies of the pest; and pollinator\nspecies such as bees can be harmed, resulting in low crop yields. Also, persistent\npesticide residues impair air, soil, and water quality.\nBoth the conventional and organic farming communities increasingly embrace IPM.\nIt emphasizes identifying pests, monitoring pest infestations, encouraging their\nnatural enemies, and controlling pest outbreaks and injury to crops with preference\ngiven to the least toxic materials available that are capable of effecting control.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, IPM is a series of pest\nmanagement evaluations, decisions, and practices. In practicing IPM, growers\nconcerned with the potential for pest infestation follow a four-tiered approach.\nOrganic production highlight\nOrganic certification\nIf you have not used prohibited\nproducts on your farm for three years,\nyou may be eligible for organic\ncertification. To claim to be “organic”\n(with annual gross sales over $5,000),\nyour farm will need to be inspected and\ncertified by an accredited agency. Be\nprepared to provide detailed information\nto document your growing practices and\nhistory (pest, disease, and fertilization\nstrategies, land use history, and a\ndetailed map).

Other practices mentioned, albeit by a very \nminor proportion of respondents were; planting shelter trees, \nand maintaining an open dam on the farm to provide access \nto a water source. Practices for conserving pollinators were \nto a large extent similar to those used for conserving natural \nenemies.

We might cut\nsome of our input costs there.\nImprove crop rotation practices.  As we see declines in our quota, we will have more land available for\nplanting the remaining quota.  Take advantage of that.  The lengthy rotation periods are better for us in\nterms of pest and disease pressures.  We need to improve our crop rotation practices to the degree that\nwe are able.\nFinally, negotiate rental rates.  I think that is one of the key issues that is probably going to be a\ncontentious one.  It is, however, something that must be dealt with.  Rent is one of our input costs that\ncan be negotiated.  It is up to producers and land owners to get together to negotiate those rates.\nWhat else can you do (Slide 10)?  Be wary of large capital investments.  We have had a profitable\nenterprise in peanuts.  It is easy to want to buy new equipment and invest in new technology.  Be wary\nof making capital investments at this point in time until we see how much these prices are actually\ngoing to decline and what kind of quota changes are going to occur.  You also have to be concerned\nabout your debt repayment schedules.  They were probably scheduled based on the price support level\nfor peanuts that you have come to expect over time.  All of a sudden, it is not there any more.  Be\naware of how that change is going to impact not only your debt repayment schedule but also your\nability to repay those debts.\nFinally, we need to be concerned about the decline in domestic consumption.  Individually you\nprobably can do little, but a grower organization might be able to have an impact.  What kinds of\nprograms can we undertake to encourage a resurgence in domestic demand for peanuts?  Be attuned to\nconsumers’ perceptions.  It is easy for folks to look from the outside in, to say negative things about\npesticide use and other cultural practices.  Be aware of consumers’ perceptions of your commodity.\nContinue to practice the good land stewardship you have always used so that there is nothing negative\nthat anyone can focus on.  It is possible to have some kind of scare in the peanut industry similar to the\nalar scare in the apple industry.  We do not need any kind of negative perceptions.', 'url': 'https://www.sites.ext.vt.edu/newsletter-archive/REAP/Reports/Risk%20Managment%20Peanuts,%20Cotton,%20Tobacco.pdf'}, {'base_url': 'https://extension.usu.edu', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 34, 'readable_filename': 'CropProducersGuide.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/CropProducersGuide.pdf', 'text': 'www.ams.usda.gov/nop                                 Guide for Organic Crop Producers\nPage 34\nSanitation: Sanitation entails the removal of sources of disease infection or insect pest \ninfestation. For example, apple and pear growers remove branches infected with fire blight \n(strikes). The strikes are removed from the orchard and burned to kill the bacteria that \ncause fire blight. Mushroom growers pasteurize the compost to kill fungi that would  \ncompete with the mushroom crop.\nTrap crops: These are small plantings of a crop or crop variety intended to draw a par-\nticular pest away from the main crop. For example, alfalfa planted in strips amid cotton \nattracts lygus bugs away from the cotton crop. Typically, trap crops must be destroyed to \nkill the pests that have been attracted to them. Use of trap crops requires a good under-\nstanding of the biology of the pest. \nExamples of Level B practices to manage pests and diseases\nBurning crop residues: In organic production, the burning of crop residues is allowed only for \nsuppression of disease. Rice straw often is burned in the field. Before using this disease-con-\ntrol practice, it must be clearly stated in the organic system plan and approved by the certifier.\nCanopy management: By training and pruning trees, orchardists can increase airflow and \ndecrease disease pressure. Viticulturists practice leaf removal to control Botrytis bunch rot \nof grapes. \nIntroducing insect predators and parasites: Several types of insects can be purchased in \nlarge quantities and released on the farm. For example, to control aphids, release ladybugs \nand provide favorable conditions to encourage the ladybugs to stay and eat the aphids. \nMulching: Mulching can reduce disease on tomatoes and similar crops by reducing soil \ncontact and maintaining an even soil moisture. However, organic mulches also can serve \nas habitat for certain pests, such as the squash bug and slugs.\nRow covers: Floating row covers, made of lightweight fabric, can keep insects out of short-\nseason crops. For example, they can prevent flea beetles in arugula and prevent cabbage \nroot maggots in radishes. \nSolarization: Soil solarization is achieved by covering the soil with plastic during the summer. \nThis allows the soil to get hot enough to kill many pathogens, yet it allows microbial spores \nto survive. Survivors can re-establish the microbial populations needed for healthy soil.\nWeed management\nAccording to the USDA’s Invasive Weed Management Unit, the most critical problem fac-\ning today’s organic grower is weeds. Weeds compete with crops for moisture, nutrients, and \nsunlight. Weeds do not always need to be eliminated—short weeds in a tall corn crop may \nbe harmless—but weeds do need to be managed. Fortunately, there are many classic ways \nto reduce the number of weed seeds, and new ways are being developed to remove weeds \nthat compete with crops. The appearance of many difficult-to-control weeds may be an \nindication that the soil has nutritional or physical problems and nature is trying to restore \nhealth and balance. \nExamples of Level A practices to manage weeds\nVariety selection: Select grain varieties that emerge early and close the canopy as quickly \nas possible. This shades the soil so weeds are not as competitive.\nHigh-crop seeding rates: Some crops can be planted at high rates to smother weeds. \nAnother strategy is to increase the crop density by decreasing within-row distance or \nbetween-row distance. This is especially true when planting cover crops, forages, or grains.', 'url': 'https://cms.organictransition.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CropProducersGuide.pdf'}]},

Could you give me some advice on how to proceed?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Absolutely! A good starting point is Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This approach emphasizes the use of beneficial insects, crop rotation, and biological controls. It also involves monitoring pest populations and only resorting to chemical controls when necessary. Do you currently employ any of these practices?\n\n**Farmer**: Yes, I do use crop rotation and I try to encourage beneficial insects. But sometimes, the pest problem still gets out of hand. \n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: That's a good start! To enhance your current practices, consider diversifying your crops. A diverse farm is less vulnerable to pests as it's harder for pests to spread when their preferred food source is scattered. Also, you could consider using cover crops. They are extremely effective at reducing the emergence of some pests. \n\n**Farmer**: That's interesting! I've heard about cover crops but never really thought about them in terms of pest management. What about natural pesticides? I've heard there are some options out there.\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Yes, there are organically acceptable chemical controls you can use as a last resort. These are derived from natural sources and are generally less harmful to the environment. However, they should still be used judiciously and only when other methods have been exhausted. And always ensure that any pesticides you use are allowed under organic regulations if you are or plan to be certified as an organic farm.\n\n**Farmer**: I see, I'll certainly look into those options.

So, those are different times when you might want to put on the expert hat. And hopefully the audience will realize why you’re doing that. – Mary (FCS, State 2).\n\nIndividual Questions/Crop Production: On another token, some of the work I do, there’s some facts that I know that are established and they’ve been established through years of research. And, I can tell a grower, “You know what, if you come into this field with the combine, the way your beans are situated and the height of your pods, you are very likely going to have a disaster.” I mean, I can kind of in an expert way say, it doesn’t mean I know everything about growing and farming beans and it doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of input as well, but on that specific point and that specific question, I can come across with a more expert, authoritative recommendation, based on knowledge and research. It would be a little bit like I just said. Some cut-and- dried, research-based information that I can impart. You know, if you have soil ridges in your field that are holding up the head of your combine, every inch of height that you raise on that combine is going to be the equivalent to about three bushels per acre harvest loss in yield. I can just tell a grower that and that’s based on, you know, multiple years of research, it’s a piece of valuable information. Then, they might not know it. So, if I really know my facts, or know this is such and such an insect, or you know, then I would impart that knowledge in that, in an authoritative, probably not the right word, but very, in a very confident fashion and they accept or reject that piece of information as they chose. – Ruby (ANR, State 1).\n\nIndividual Questions/Insect Identification: Well, for example, someone brings an insect, I’m a crops educator, but I deal with lawn and garden and in- sects and a wide array of questions and so on, so if somebody brings an insect into the office and asks me what it is and I say “It’s a bedbug,” and I would (have) no qualms or questions, because I know for sure that’s what it is. I guess that would be the expert model. You know, I know what it is and they are asking me, so, boom, I give them the information. I mean if I didn’t know what something was, then I’d say, “Well I’m not sure, it looks like this. I’ll have to investigate this more and then I’ll get back with you.” I guess I’m still not asking for their input. – Ruby (ANR, State 1).\n\nIndividual Questions/Pesticide Recommendations or Ration Balancing: Most people view me as a specialist in the areas of animal science and agrono- my, and so I get calls related to what pesticide to use, how to balance a ration for my steers in the feedlot, and so they’re basically drawing on my expertise or my ability to find that information for them. – Pike County (ANR, State 2).', 'url': 'https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/pubs_ext_vt_edu/en/ALCE/alce-301/alce-301.html'}, {'base_url': 'https://www.lsuagcenter.com', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 50, 'readable_filename': 'pesticidestewardshipmanual_ipm_pdfpdf.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/pesticidestewardshipmanual_ipm_pdfpdf.pdf', 'text': 'The Pesticide Stewardship of Specialty Crops Train the Trainer Handbook   |   Module 6       50\nSCOUTING/MONITORING\nA\nScouting (or monitoring) is a simple and effective \ntechnique for detection of pests before they reach \ndamaging levels.

If they \nare present, pests must be identified. Next, you must determine  \nif the pest problem is bad enough that control is necessary. \n \nWhen there are enough pests present to reduce yields, pests \nneed to be controlled. This amount of pest population is called \nthe economic threshold level. When the economic threshold level \nhas been reached, you must select the best control methods. \nEconomic thresholds are different for each crop, stage of plant \ngrowth, and level of pest problem.

Because \nanswering customer questions is so important, this \npublication provides all ag retail employees with \na foundation for answering commonly asked \ncustomer questions and points out pitfalls to watch \nfor.

This is very important for pesticide applicators. Lawsuits about crop protection products such as glyphosate, dicamba, atrazine, and chlorpyrifos—along with growing complaints from residential neighborhoods expanding into agricultural districts—illustrate the importance of maintaining a healthy professional image communicating that agriculture is the public’s friend. Steps for building and maintaining a positive impression include:\n\nSafe, educated, and effective site-specific pesticide and fertilizer applications\nMaintaining a clean, organized barnyard with well-maintained buildings, fences, and equipment\nProperly disposing waste\nEmploying visible best management practices such as windbreaks, vegetative filter buffers along swales, and surface water treatment wetlands\nManaging soil erosion and sedimentation\nWildlife habitat maintenance and creation including snags, brush piles, and edge habitat\nMaintaining and protecting streams, wetlands, and ponds\nConservation measures such as native vegetation patches and forest preservation\nDeveloping good relationships with neighbors\nTaking time to educate neighbors and the public at every opportunity\nIdentifying potential conflicts and creating allies with such individuals or groups. Examples include collaboration with local beekeepers if you use insecticides, volunteering with local watershed groups, or joining a conservation organization like Quail Forever or the Missouri Prairie Foundation. Learn their interests and concerns to see how your farm can contribute to the local cause to develop trust and lasting partnerships.\n\nA shift is needed for the long-term preservation of agriculture. Instead of attempting to maximize profit by farming every available acre, agriculture producers can instead use swales, corners, riparian zones, and less fertile soil areas for conservation features that invest in the region’s water quality, wildlife, and community. While this proactive approach takes work and sacrificing a little land, it is cheap insurance against the wasted time and money spent on future litigation and public battles. Such measures show a good faith effort by agriculture to steward the environment we all share, which develops public confidence. Now is the time to grab this opportunity to build relationships before pesticide lawsuit commercials and anti-pesticide websites turn the public against agriculture.\n\nLaws and regulations\n\nLaws and regulations are a continually shifting force in the world of agriculture and pesticide application. A summary of updates on pesticide related laws and regulations found in new manual can be seen in MU Extension publication, G855, Pesticide Laws and Regulations.\n\nEndangered Species Act\n\nWhile the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was mentioned in the 2007 manual, the updated manual covers the usage of EPA’s required Bulletins Live! Two so applicators ensure they minimize potential risk to endangered species listed in the area. The ESA is proving to be a challenge to product registration, making understanding and compliance critical.\n\nWorker Protection Standard\n\nThe Worker Protection Standard found in the Agricultural Use Requirements on pesticide labels was updated in 2015. These changes are outlined in the updated manual and the following MU Extension publications:\n\nG856, Worker Protection Standard Overview\nG857, Worker Protection: Employer’s Guide to Worker Protection Standard Compliance\nG858, Agricultural Owners, Family Labor and the Worker Protection Standard\nClean Water Act\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA) was absent in previous manuals. The CWA establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. The basis of the CWA was enacted in 1948 and was called the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, but the Act was significantly reorganized and expanded in 1972 [33 U.S.C. §1251 et seq. (1972)]. “Clean Water Act” became the Act’s common name with amendments in 1972.', 'url': 'https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g854'}, {'base_url': 'https://extension.umaine.edu', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 1, 'readable_filename': '5120.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/5120.pdf', 'text': 'Farmer Skill and Knowledge Checklist: \nWhat Maine Farmers Need to Know about Pesticides \n \nDeveloped by Kerry Bernard, Pesticide Safety Education Professional, University of Maine Cooperative \nExtension and Richard Brzozowski, Program Administrator, University of Maine Cooperative Extension. \n \nThis checklist is a guide to the types of skills and knowledge necessary for farmers and farm workers who use \nor will use pesticides on crops.

Regardless of the magni-\ntude of a spill, the objectives of a proper \nresponse are the same—you must con-\ntrol the spill, you must contain it, and you \nmust clean it up. A thorough knowledge \nof appropriate procedures will allow you \nto minimize the potential for adverse \neffects.\nSpills of any compound need to be \nreported to the DNR. However, you do \nnot need to report the spill if it is com-\npletely confined within an impervious \nsecondary containment and the spilled \namount can be recovered with no dis-\ncharge to the environment. On the other \nhand, a spill of any amount is reportable \nif it occurred outside of secondary con-\ntainment and it harmed, or threatens to \nharm, human health or the environment \n(e.g., back siphoning). The spill is exempt \nfrom the DNR reporting requirements if: \n• \nyou deem the spill will not harm, or \nthreaten to harm, human health or \nthe environment AND\n• \nthe amount spilled would cover less \nthan 1 acre if applied at labeled rates \nAND \n• \nif a SARA pesticide, it is less than the \nreportable quantity.\nReportable spills involving SARA sub-\nstances (see “Pesticides and Community \nRight to\xa0Know” on page 20) are also to \nbe reported to WEM and to your LEPC.

Morning or late evening is usually the best time to spray.\n\nPrecautions\nRead and follow all directions and safety precautions on labels.\nStore pesticides in original containers, out of reach of children, pets and livestock.\nDispose of empty containers immediately in a safe manner and place. Triple rinse.\nDo not contaminate forage, watersheds or water sources.\nBecome familiar with life cycles of pests to properly time applications.\nKeep a complete diary of applications: crop, date of planting, pests, weather conditions, materials, date of application and amounts applied.\nAdhere to farm worker protection standards.\nEmergency Information\nHuman Exposure\n\nIf someone has swallowed or inhaled a pesticide or gotten it in the eye or on the skin:\n\nCall 911 if the person in unconscious, having trouble breathing, or having convulsions.\nCheck the label for directions on how to give first aid.\nCall the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for help with first aid information.\n\nThe National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) (1-800-858-7378) can also provide information about pesticide products and their toxicity.\n\nSpills\n\nThe National Response Center (NRC) is the sole federal point of contact for reporting oil and chemical spills. If you have a spill to report, contact NRC at 1-800-424-8802 (toll-free) or visit their website (https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/national-response-center) for additional information on reporting requirements and procedures. The NRC can help you decide how to respond to a spill.\xa0Producers should be aware that they may be required to report spills to their state Lead Agency (SLA) for pesticide regulation or their state department of environmental protection.\n\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensations, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires that all releases of hazardous substances exceeding reportable quantities be reported by the responsible party to the National Response Center (NRC). Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 302 promulgates reportable quantities and reporting criteria. All the Extremely Hazardous Chemicals (EHS) that overlap with the CERCLA listed chemicals table (40 CFR Part 302.4) should be reported to NRC as well as to the LEPC and SERC.\n\nFor small pesticide spills or for more information, call the pesticide manufacturer or the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) at 1-800-858-7378.\n\nMore Information\n\nCHEMTREC maintains a large database of Material Safety Data Sheets, chemical information references, resources, and networks of chemical and hazardous material experts who can provide access to technical information regarding chemical products (Emergency call 1-800-424-9300,\xa0in the U.S. or 703-741-5500 outside the U.S.).\n\nFor more information, contact the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) at 1-800-858-7378.\n\nFumigation: Materials and Risks\n\nThe practice of soil fumigation carries significant risks. These risks include the health and safety of agricultural workers and others who can be exposed to these materials, environmental risks from misapplication or accidents and other hazards.\xa0 Another risk is treatment failure from reintroducing pathogens on transplant material or farm equipment. This can cause a phenomenon called “the boomerang effect” in which a pathogen is (re)introduced in a partially sterilized soil and proliferates rapidly because checks and balances no longer exist in that soil. In such a case, the resulting epidemic is worse than if the soil had never been fumigated. So, it is very important to take care to plant very clean transplant material and to use only clean equipment when working in a newly fumigated field.', 'url': 'https://ag.umass.edu/book/export/html/15691'}, {'base_url': 'https://extension.missouri.edu', 'course_name ': 'cropwizard-1.5', 'pagenumber': 3, 'readable_filename': 'g00854.pdf', 's3_path': 'courses/cropwizard-1.5/g00854.pdf', 'text': 'page 3\ng854 \nUniversity of Missouri Extension\n• Identify nearby crops sensitive to, or not labeled for, \nthe product\n• Coordinate with managers and workers to vacate \nthe application site\n• Coordinate with the irrigation manager\nProfessional image\nThose in the agriculture industry should take \nthe initiative to shift the public view of agriculture \nin a positive direction.

I want to ensure not only the effectiveness of the pesticides, but also the safety of my workers and minimal environmental impact.\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: That's a great approach to have. Ensuring safety and minimizing environmental impact is as important as effective pest control. Let's start by discussing your current practices. How are you currently managing pesticide application?\n\n**Farmer**: Well, I've been using a certain pesticide brand for a few years now. However, I'm not sure if I'm doing everything correctly. My workers use protective gear, but I'm concerned about potential exposure and environmental harm.\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: It's good to hear you have protective gear in place. However, safety doesn't stop there. Have you considered implementing an integrated pest management (IPM) plan? This approach can help reduce the need for pesticides by using a variety of methods to control pests.\n\n**Farmer**: I have heard of IPM but wasn't sure how to implement it. Could you tell me more about it and how it can help?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Absolutely. An integrated pest management plan involves regular monitoring of pest populations, using natural predators or biological control methods, and applying chemical controls only when necessary. This not only reduces the amount of pesticides used but also helps prevent pesticide resistance.\n\n**Farmer**: That sounds like a good plan. I'll start implementing an IPM plan right away. But when it is necessary to use pesticides, what precautions should I take to ensure the safety of my workers and the environment?\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Excellent question. First, always ensure that your workers are properly trained on pesticide use and safety measures. This includes understanding the product labels, using the correct application rates, and adhering to reentry intervals. It's also crucial to use the right protective gear. For environmental safety, follow the guidelines on the pesticide label regarding wind speed and direction, temperature, and rainfall to avoid pesticide drift or runoff. And remember, always store and dispose of pesticide containers safely to prevent contamination.\n\n**Farmer**: Thank you for the advice. I'll ensure to implement these safety measures and start working on an IPM plan. I appreciate your help.\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: You're welcome! It's great to see farmers taking these issues seriously. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions.

And, I can tell a grower, “You know what, if you come into this field with the combine, the way your beans are situated and the height of your pods, you are very likely going to have a disaster.” I mean, I can kind of in an expert way say, it doesn’t mean I know everything about growing and farming beans and it doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot of input as well, but on that specific point and that specific question, I can come across with a more expert, authoritative recommendation, based on knowledge and research. It would be a little bit like I just said. Some cut-and- dried, research-based information that I can impart. You know, if you have soil ridges in your field that are holding up the head of your combine, every inch of height that you raise on that combine is going to be the equivalent to about three bushels per acre harvest loss in yield. I can just tell a grower that and that’s based on, you know, multiple years of research, it’s a piece of valuable information. Then, they might not know it. So, if I really know my facts, or know this is such and such an insect, or you know, then I would impart that knowledge in that, in an authoritative, probably not the right word, but very, in a very confident fashion and they accept or reject that piece of information as they chose. – Ruby (ANR, State 1).\n\nIndividual Questions/Insect Identification: Well, for example, someone brings an insect, I’m a crops educator, but I deal with lawn and garden and in- sects and a wide array of questions and so on, so if somebody brings an insect into the office and asks me what it is and I say “It’s a bedbug,” and I would (have) no qualms or questions, because I know for sure that’s what it is. I guess that would be the expert model. You know, I know what it is and they are asking me, so, boom, I give them the information. I mean if I didn’t know what something was, then I’d say, “Well I’m not sure, it looks like this.

I've noticed that corn borers, aphids and tomato hornworms are quite prevalent.\n\n**Agriculture Specialist**: Good start! Now, think about how these pests impact your crops.
